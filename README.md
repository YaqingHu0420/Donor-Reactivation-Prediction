# ML Project: Predicting Donor Reactivation
## Overview
This project aims to predict donors likely to reactivate and contribute more than â‚¬30 to targeted campaigns. Utilizing machine learning enables nonprofit organizations to focus their outreach on the most promising donors, optimizing resources and improving campaign effectiveness.

## Project Objectives
Build a predictive model to identify potential donors for reactivation campaigns.
Utilize advanced machine learning techniques to guide targeted fundraising efforts.
Provide actionable insights for donor management and campaign optimization.

## Key Steps and Methods
1. Data Preprocessing
- Cleaned and standardized the dataset for better analysis.
- Addressed missing data to ensure completeness.
- Encoded categorical variables into numerical formats.
- Scaled numerical features to improve model performance.

2. Model Development
- Evaluated six machine learning models, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Ensemble Methods (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- Selected top-performing models based on AUC scores.

3. Model Evaluation and Insights
- Visualized and assessed performance using:
- Lift Curves: Highlighted the ability to focus on high-probability donors.
- Cumulative Gains: Illustrated the proportion of donors captured at different thresholds.
- Classification Report: Summarized precision, recall, and F1-score to provide insights into model performance.
